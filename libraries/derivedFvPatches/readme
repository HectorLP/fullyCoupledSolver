Original BCs: 
	1. subsurfaceTopBC: mixed, depending on the flux sign
	2. surfaceBottomBC: mixed, depending on the flux sign

New BCs to ensure the diffusive flux is the same (this is not used as of Feb. 2019):
	1. subsurfaceTopFixedValueBC: fixed value
	2. surfaceBottomFixedValueBC: fixed value

zeroNetFluxVelocity: zero out the fluid flux across the interface. Otherwise in an enclosed 
        domain the fluid solver complains about continuity error.
